# Chess-Game-AI-MINIMAX
This. Is. An. Algorithm. Not. An. IA.


Just a not very time consuming Chess AI game I've made after learning about the minimax algorithm.


Just a list of stuff I like about my implementation:

- The graphics are pretty nice.
- The marking of available moves to make.
- The "AI" difficulty.
- The REDO MOVEMENT coward option.

Stuff I don't like:

- No castling and when a pawn reaches the opponent's first line, the game just crashes ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
- Nothing happens when is check-mate until your king is dead.
- The typography is cool but somehow I made it look cheap and "8-bitty"
- No sound since my Ubuntu audio software is broken somehow.
- No title or game-finished screen.



UPDATE: Turns out my minimax if pretty broken so I've modified an existing library for Python that (for some reason) also had a bunch of errors and was pretty unusable.
